This is a project for the Advanced Bioinformatics course at Utah Tech University (BIOL 4310)

Gene expression in species varies across tissue types and in the same tissues across populations. In this dataset we have two sets of transcriptomic data: 

Dataset 1: 17 individuals from three populations (skeletal muscle)

Dataset 2: six individuals from a single population (heart, liver, and skeletal muscle)

Each of these datasets require read cleaning, mapping to an annotated genome, and obtaining a read count matrix for each gene. Analyses of the two datasets diverge at this point, where gene expression  differences between populations (Dataset 1) and differences between tissue types (Dataset 2) are examined.

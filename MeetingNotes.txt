# Questions:

1. Need to attach the correct link to the code that was referenced
2. Retaining the 'EFTS' from each gff file... hope that is correct

We need to:
1- filter variants for quality
2- convert the MiCFiG GFF to a BED file
3- filter variants for position

Useful code for each of these can be found on an old script I wrote: https://bedops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/installation.html#linux

For step 1, use the function "hard-variant-filtration" function to filter variants (you can skip step 3).

For step 2, convert the GFF from MiCFiG to a BED file. You can do this using bedops, then you need to bgzip and index it. All of this done in the function "probes2gff" (after the "# Use bedops to convert gff to bed" comment).

For step 3, we will want two resulting files: (i) variants in mitochondrial-targetting genes [those specified in the MiCFiG GFF] and (ii) variants in all other genes [all genes not specified in the MiCFiG GFF]

Use the "annotate-variants" function to filter variants based on genes of interest. The awk command at the end of the script removes all variants lacking annotation. You can modify this to exclude any variants containing annotations. Doing both of these will allow you to get both of the vcf files that we need.

Baylee's addition:
The purpose of this research is to find the differences in mitochondrial gene expression from the paternal vs. maternal lineage. A. Scalaris and A. Marmoratus came together and produces the asexual species A. tesselatus. A tesselatus retains the paternal alleles of the mitochondrial genes, so we are doing this research to determine if these expression levels are different with genes that originate from both the maternal and paternal alleles.
We will not be able to separate all gene expression levels based of the maternal/paternal allele, because we are using a variant caller to see the differences between tesselatus and marmoratus. The SNPS with variants are those that we know originate from scalaris. Some gene expression levels we will be unable to distinguish from another in the scenarios where mamoratus and tesselatus have no mutations between the genes.

Baylee is going to look into using BCFtools to call SNPs from the BAM files. To do this, check out the bcftools documentation: https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/howtos/variant-calling.html
From the output bcf file (or vcf file), we will want to exclude all genes not targetting the mitochondrion. We will use MiCFiG to provide the regions of interest, and then we can use the coordinates of those regions to filter the vcf file.
From there, we will want to combine the vcf data (the snp data) with the gene count data to identify regions where there has been allele-biased expression.
Action items just for this week:

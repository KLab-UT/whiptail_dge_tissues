Bash script is now functional. We did not have enough time to complete the trim during lecture... Retry on Tuesday
To do:
1. Copy Am 1-15,25-27 to working directory

The command we are using to run this script is: 
bash /uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/u6057891/whiptail_dge_tissues/bash_scripts/new_trim_rna_reads.sh
1. At this point in time, we need to move all of the data from the 'shared_data" directory into our wokring directory
2. After moving all of the data, we need to rethink our paths to this data

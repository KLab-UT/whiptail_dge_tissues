## Documentation
### Project Objectives
1. Dissect the differences in mitochondrial gene expression from paternal and
   maternal lineages in the asexual species A. tesselatus.
2. Draft documented and reproducible bioinformatic pipeline to generate results
3. Present research in oral engagement, showcasing best practice techniques

### Project questions
1. How does mitochondrial gene expression in Aspidoscelis tesselatus differ in
   paternal and maternal lineages?
2. We predict that paternal mitochondrial gene function will be downregulated in
   aspidoscelis tesselatus because..
3.
### Abstract
Whiptail lizards exhibit a fascinating reproductive strategy known as parthenogenesis, where females reproduce asexually, producing genetically identical offspring without male contribution. This mode of reproduction has implications for mitochondrial function, as asexual species often display lower-quality mitochondrial activity compared to their sexually reproducing counterparts. In this study, we focus on the differential gene expression in mitochondrial genes among whiptail populations, aiming to uncover potential consequences of parthenogenesis on cellular function.

By sequencing multiple individuals, we define the paternal and maternal lineage boundaries within the mitochondrial genome, offering insight into how gene expression differs across these lineages. Our findings suggest that parthenogenetic species may experience compromised mitochondrial function due to a lack of genetic diversity, impacting energy production and overall fitness. This research sheds light on the evolutionary trade-offs of asexual reproduction and contributes to our understanding of mitochondrial dynamics in asexually reproducing organisms.

### Project Objectives
1. Dissect the differences in mitochondrial gene expression from paternal and
   maternal lineages in the asexual species A. tesselatus.
2. Draft documented and reproducible bioinformatic pipeline to generate results
3. Present research in oral engagement, showcasing best practice techniques

### Project questions and Focus
How does mitochondrial gene expression in Aspidoscelis tesselatus differ in
paternal and maternal lineages?

We attempt to understand the mitochondrial respiration dynamics through gene
expression in the mitochondrial genome and the mitonuclear genome.

##### Interparental Incompatibility
In this scenario, we would predict to see a higher or equal amount of
paternal gene expression compared to maternal gene expression. A potential
mechanism that could explain this would be paternal gene products are
produced, but do not have the same compatibility with maternal gene
products, as the paternal lineage is a 'different species' and therefore
did not co-evolve with the maternal lineage of mitochondrial products.
##### Intraparental Incompatibility
In this scenario, we would predict to see a lower amount of gene expression in
the paternal lineage compared to the maternal lineage. There are many mechanisms
that could explain this scenario, one being that the maternal gene products that
interact with each other is present but not functioning ideally. More maternal
expression may be occurring in an attempt to accommodate for this insufficiency.

### Hypothesis
1. Lower mitonchondrial function is due to differing mitonuclear dynamics in the
   unisexual species compared to asexual species

### Abstract
Whiptail lizards exhibit a fascinating reproductive strategy known as parthenogenesis, where females reproduce asexually, producing genetically identical offspring without male contribution. This mode of reproduction has implications for mitochondrial function, as asexual species often display lower-quality mitochondrial activity compared to their sexually reproducing counterparts. In this study, we focus on the differential gene expression in mitochondrial genes among whiptail populations, aiming to uncover potential consequences of parthenogenesis on cellular function.

By sequencing multiple individuals, we define the paternal and maternal lineage boundaries within the mitochondrial genome, offering insight into how gene expression differs across these lineages. Our findings suggest that parthenogenetic species may experience compromised mitochondrial function due to a lack of genetic diversity, impacting energy production and overall fitness. This research sheds light on the evolutionary trade-offs of asexual reproduction and contributes to our understanding of mitochondrial dynamics in asexually reproducing organisms.
